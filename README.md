<H2 style="text-align: center;"> An Open Source version of the Microsoft Research Open Data platform </H2>

<br />

This project is the data repository code behind the cloud hosted Microsoft Research Open Data Repository. The code can be used to instantiate a highly customizable cloud based data repository to host and share datasets under a flexible licensing infrastructure with a high level of security and privacy. It provides the ability to deploy datasets directly to an Azure Data Science VM allowing development using popular open source tools such as Python/R on Juypter notebooks, and deep learning frameworks.

This code is forked from the original code that implements Microsoft Research Open Data. Refer to the site [Microsoft Research Open Data](https://msropendata.com) for a working
 example of what a data repository instance based on this code will look like. 

The repository code can be used to:
- Create a storage service for producers to securely store datasets in the Azure cloud
- Create a customizable, fully responsive cross-device (web + mobile + tablet), and cross-platform user interfaces: 
    1) for users to browse, download, or consume the datasets on Azure computational resources
    2) for dataset administrators to onboard and administer, and monitor usage for these datasets
- Create distinct authenticated experiences for regular users and organizational users 
- Allow dataset owners to administer datasets once they have been onboarded
- Monitor dataset usage analytics that you can visualize via PowerBI or using your own dashboards through API access



Detailed technical overview can be viewed [HERE](./docs/technical-overview.md)

Detailed instructions on deploying the repository is available [HERE](./docs/deployment.md)

Once deployed, guidance on onboarding and administering datasets is available [HERE](./docs/import-dataset.md)

Additional videos that demonstrate application functionality can be found [HERE](https://github.com/microsoft/opendatacloud/releases/tag/v1.0).
